# Specialized NNUE releases of Fairy-Stockfish

[Fairy-Stockfish](https://github.com/ianfab/Fairy-Stockfish) can also load NNUE networks at runtime, but for some users who only focus on a single variant a dedicated release with a single built-in NNUE network is more convenient. Therefore this repository provides such specialized releases for the regional variants such as Xiangqi, Janggi, and Makruk. Besides this convenience feature and the difference in binary size, there is no functional difference to the [general purpose releases](https://github.com/ianfab/Fairy-Stockfish/releases).
